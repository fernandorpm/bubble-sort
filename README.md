# Ruby Bubble Sort

> On this project, we had to build two bubble sort methods in ruby, while on the second one we were required to sort the array by passing a block and using 'yield' on the method.

This is how the bubble sort works: by comparing the current position on the array with the next one, until the last index of the array.
And then, the process is repeated until the array is arranged in a crescent way.
